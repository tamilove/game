      <h1>Birthdate Guessing Game</h1>
      <p> <img src="http://www.southsea.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Street-Party.jpg" width="320" height="232" /> You can play this guessing game at any party. It's a fun way to iscolate yourself as the nerd of the group and ever so slightly interesting. The idea is to guess how many people are need to be in a room such that there is a 90% probabily that two of the guests have the same birthdate.

      <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
      <h5>thank you Wikipedia<h5>
        <p>The birthday problem is to find the probability that, in a group of N people, there is at least one pair of people who have the same birthday. See "Same birthday as you" further for an analysis of the case of finding the probability of a given, fixed person having the same birthday as any of the remaining N - 1 people.

In the example given earlier, a list of 23 people, comparing the birthday of the first person on the list to the others allows 22 chances for a matching birthday, the second person on the list to the others allows 21 chances for a matching birthday (in fact the 'second' person also has total 22 chances of matching birthday with the others but his/her chance of matching birthday with the 'first' person, one chance, has already been counted with the first person's 22 chances and shall not be duplicated), third person has 20 chances, and so on. Hence total chances are: 22+21+20+\cdots+1 = 253, so comparing every person to all of the others allows 253 distinct chances (combinations): in a group of 23 people there are \textstyle {23 \choose 2} = \frac{23 \cdot 22}{2} = 253 distinct possible combinations of pairing.

Presuming all birthdays are equally probable,[4] the probability of a given birthday for a person chosen from the entire population at random is 1/365 (ignoring February 29). Although the number of pairings in a group of 23 people is not statistically equivalent to 253 pairs chosen independently, the birthday problem becomes less surprising if a group is thought of in terms of the number of possible pairs, rather than as the number of individuals.
